Let us assume the standard 3D-MOT arrangement illustrated in figure \ref{fig:standard-3D-MOT-arrangement}. An atom, free to move along all Cartesian axes, interacts with \textit{three pairs} of counter-propagating laser beams with opposite circular polarization and a magnetic quadrupole field $ \mathbf{B} $. In a first attempt, we can naturally extend the 1D-MOT theory into a 3D theory considering that each laser beam yields a radiation pressure force given by equation (\ref{eq:1D-MOT-force-components}). Nevertheless, the quantization axis ($z$-axis) must match the direction of the field $ \mathbf{B} $ to proper evaluate the Zeeman shift, which implies that each laser beam polarization depends on the atomic position. This is not a concern in the 1D-MOT since the magnetic field has a fixed direction. Therefore, a theoretical description of the 3D-MOT \cite{prudnikov2015three} encounters considerable difficult due to the spatial-dependence of the quantization axis. Regardless the theoretical complications, the cooling and trapping effects of MOTs are widely confirmed for many alkali \cite{raab1987trapping, katori1999magneto, zachorowski1998magneto} and lanthanide \cite{maier2014narrow, miyazawa2021narrow, frisch2012narrow}. Also, in this thesis, we could demonstrate both effects for dysprosium and strontium atoms through a Monte Carlo simulation.

\subsection{Limit temperature in Doppler cooling}
\label{sec:Doppler-temperature-limit}
%-----------------------------------

Let us consider a equilibrium atomic position close to the magnetic field centre. In this case, the Zeeman shift becomes negligible compared to the Doppler shift ($ \delta_{Z} \ll \delta_{D} $) such that a defined quantization axis is no longer required. \footnote{Essentially, we are proposing the treatment of a MOT as an \textbf{optical molasses}, which is a similar technique to only cool an atomic dilute gas based upon \textit{Doppler cooling}.} Also, we suppose weak atom-light couplings in which the laser detuning are grater than the power-broadened linewidth. Thus, the interaction between each laser beam and the atom is independent and it is described by two-level dynamics. In this situation, the MOT force is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_{MOT}(\mathbf{v}) = \frac{\hbar k \Gamma s_0}{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{3} \left( \frac{1}{1 + s_0 + 4[\delta - k (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_n)]^2 / \Gamma^2} - \frac{1}{1 + s_0 + 4[\delta + k (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_n)]^2 / \Gamma^2} \right)\mathbf{e}_{n},
\end{equation}
where $ \{ \mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3 \}$ is the Cartesian basis. We are assuming all laser beams with the same saturation parameter $ s_0 $, wavevector magnitude $ k $, and detuning $ \delta $. For low velocities $ v $ such that $ kv \ll \delta $, we can expand the MOT force around $ \mathbf{v} = 0 $ so that $ \mathbf{F}_{MOT} \simeq - \gamma \mathbf{v} $,
\begin{equation}
	\gamma = - \frac{8 \hbar k^2 s_0 (\delta / \Gamma)}{[1 + s_0 + 4(\delta / \Gamma)^2]^2}.
\end{equation}
Assuming red-detuned laser beams ($ \delta < 0 $), we have $ \gamma > 0 $ and then $ \mathbf{F}_{MOT} $ describes a friction force. Hence, the velocity vanishes after a time as long as $ 1 / \gamma $ and then the final temperature should be zero. However, the $ \mathbf{F}_{MOT} $ is an average. We also must to consider the variance effect of $ \mathbf{F}_{MOT} $ which relies on the Brownian atomic motion due to spontaneous emission. This random dynamics yields a \textit{heating process}. Therefore, the balance between cooling and heating mechanisms set finite temperature.

From the \textit{equipartition theorem}, the average total energy of the atom is given by
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}^2}{2m} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T,
\end{equation}
where $ T $ is the temperature of the atomic cloud, $m$ is the the atomic mass, and $ \mathbf{p} $ is the linear momentum of the atom. There is an association between the \textbf{diffusion coefficient}\footnote{Correlation between the $\mathbf{F}_{MOT}(t) $ and $ \mathbf{F}_{MOT}(t + \delta t) $, where $ t $ is a specific instant and $ \delta t $ is a time interval.} $ D $ and the quantity $ \Delta \mathbf{p}^2 $ given by $ \Delta \mathbf{p}^2 \approx D / \gamma $ \cite[Section~2]{perrin2014doppler}. To obtain an expression for $ D $, we need to calculate quantum fluctuations, which is out of the scope of this work. However, skipping this step \cite[Section~2.3]{perrin2014doppler}, there are two possible regimes in which we can define a temperature \cite[Section~V]{loftus2004narrow}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{High saturation} ($ s_0 \gg 1 $):
	\begin{equation}
		T(s_0) = \sqrt{s_0} T_0
		\label{eq:Doppler-temperature-high-saturation}
	\end{equation}
	\item \textbf{Low saturation} ($ s_0 \ll 1 $):
	\begin{equation}
		T(s_0, \delta) = \frac{1 + 4(\delta / \Gamma_E)^2}{4|\delta|/\Gamma_E} \sqrt{s_0} T_0
		\label{eq:Doppler-temperature-low-saturation}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
where $ T_0 \equiv \hbar \Gamma / (2 k_B) $ is known as \textbf{Doppler cooling limit} and $ \Gamma_{E} \equiv \Gamma \sqrt{1 + s_0} $ is the \textbf{power-broadened linewidth}. Considering $ s_0 \gg 1 $ in (\ref{eq:Doppler-temperature-low-saturation}), we obtain (\ref{eq:Doppler-temperature-high-saturation}). The temperature is dependent of the lasers intensity in both regimes and is dependent of the lasers detuning only in the low saturation case. However, making $ \delta \gg 1 $, the temperature of the low saturation case becomes detuning-independent. Indeed, the temperatures in both regimes are equivalent in this limit. Therefore, for high detunings and fixed saturation parameters, we expected a constant temperature.
