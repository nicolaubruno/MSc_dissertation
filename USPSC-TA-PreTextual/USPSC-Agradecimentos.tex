\begin{agradecimentos}
	I would like to acknowledge the support and patience of my advisor, Professor Emanuel A. L. Henn, who helped me proceed with my work even through the difficulties.

	Many thanks to my father, Rogério C. Santos, my mother, Adeli C. C. Santos, and my sister Andressa C. N. Santos, who supported me throughout the process by keeping me motivated and always being present when I most needed them. I could not have finished this work without them. I would also like to thank my girlfriend and also my partner, Denise S. Ribeiro, who follows my dedication and keeps supporting me during the process.

	Lastly, but not less important, I would like to thank my closest friends Adonai H. Silva, Cainã de Oliveira, Henrique Malavazzi, Raian Westin, and Vinicius Martinez (in alphabetical order since I value them equally) for all their support, insightful conversions, and unforgeable moments.

	This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001
