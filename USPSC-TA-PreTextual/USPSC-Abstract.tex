   In this work, we proposed and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate experimental quantities of narrow-line magneto-optical traps (nMOTs). Our model relies on sampling the atoms' movement as a Markov chain under laser light and a quadrupole magnetic field. We assume that the involved electronic transition can be modelled as four-level system and split into three independent two-level system, which is only valid for nMOTs in the power-broadened regime.  We were able to estimate quantities for three nMOTs arrangements at different laboratories. The first nMOT traps dysprosium atoms on an electronic transition with narrowness $ \eta = 43.8 $, which is not an ideal value since it is slightly larger. Nevertheless, we could obtain estimated quantities more accurate than the theoretical predictions. The other two nMOTs trap strontium atoms on an electronic transition with narrowness $ \eta = 1.6 $. We also could obtain estimated quantities with small errors compared to the theoretical predictions.
